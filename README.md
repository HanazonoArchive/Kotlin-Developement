1. Get Set Up
- Install IntelliJ IDEA (if you don't have it already): IntelliJ is built by the same company that developed Kotlin, and it offers fantastic support for the language.
- Add Kotlin Plugin: If you are already using IntelliJ, the Kotlin plugin might be installed by default. If not, install it through the plugin manager.
- Set Up a Simple Kotlin Project: Start by creating a simple "Hello World" project to get familiar with how Kotlin works within IntelliJ.

2. Start with Kotlin Basics (1 Week)
- Play with Kotlin’s syntax using Kotlin Playground or directly in your IDE.
   - [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/) is a great way to write small snippets of code without setting up a full project.
- Focus on key topics:
   - Variables and types: `val` vs `var`, type inference.
   - Functions: regular functions, default parameters, named arguments.
   - Conditionals and loops: `if`, `when`, `for`, `while`.
   - Null safety: Learn about Kotlin’s approach to handling nulls.
  
   Resources:  
   - [Official Kotlin Documentation - Basics](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/basic-syntax.html)
   - [JetBrains Kotlin Koans](https://play.kotlinlang.org/koans/overview): Hands-on exercises that are quick and effective.

   Tasks:
   - Convert a simple Java project (like a calculator or to-do list app) into Kotlin.
   - Write a small script to understand Kotlin’s basic syntax and data types.

3. Object-Oriented Programming (2 Weeks)
- This should feel familiar since you're proficient in Java, but learn the Kotlin-specific enhancements:
   - Classes, inheritance, interfaces.
   - Data classes: Learn how Kotlin simplifies boilerplate code with `data class`.
   - Companion objects and `object` keyword for singletons.
   - Sealed classes: Great for use cases like state machines or handling results.
   
   Resources:
   - [Kotlin OOP Guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/classes.html)
   - [Kotlin's Data Classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html)
   
   Tasks:
   - Build a class hierarchy in Kotlin, like a simple animal class example.
   - Convert some of your old Java OOP-based projects to Kotlin and refactor them using Kotlin idioms.

4. Functional Programming (1-2 Weeks)
- Kotlin makes it easy to adopt functional programming, even though it’s optional:
   - Higher-order functions and lambdas.
   - Extension functions: Add new methods to existing classes without modifying their code.
   - `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and other collection operations.
   - Learn about immutability and how Kotlin encourages it.

   Resources:
   - [Higher-Order Functions and Lambdas](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html)
   - [Kotlin Collections](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/collections-overview.html)

   Tasks:
   - Implement common algorithms (like sorting or searching) using functional programming techniques.
   - Use Kotlin collections and try out `map`, `filter`, `reduce`.

5. Coroutines and Asynchronous Programming (2-3 Weeks)
- Coroutines are one of Kotlin’s most powerful features for dealing with concurrency:
   - Learn how coroutines work and the basics of structured concurrency.
   - Understand `suspend` functions, coroutine scopes, and dispatchers.
   - Implement async tasks with coroutines (e.g., fetching data from an API).

   Resources:
   - [Coroutines Basics](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-basics.html)
   - [Kotlin Coroutines Tutorial](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html)

   Tasks:
   - Build a simple coroutine-based app to fetch data from a web API.
   - Use coroutines in a project to replace Java’s thread-based concurrency approach.

6. Explore Kotlin Ecosystem (2 Weeks)
- Get familiar with the tools and libraries that make Kotlin awesome:
   - Kotlin Standard Library: Explore utilities and extensions.
   - Kotlin DSLs: Learn how Kotlin is used for building DSLs (Domain Specific Languages).
   - Ktor: If you're interested in backend development, Ktor is Kotlin’s web framework.
   - Android Development with Kotlin (if you're into mobile): Kotlin is the official language for Android development now.
   
   Resources:
   - [Ktor Documentation](https://ktor.io/docs/welcome.html)
   - [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html)

   Tasks:
   - Build a simple REST API with Ktor.
   - Try writing some Gradle tasks using Kotlin DSL.

7. Build a Project (1+ Month)
- Now that you have a solid foundation, start a project:
   - If you’re into web, build a full-stack app with Kotlin backend (Ktor or Spring) and any frontend.
   - If you prefer mobile, create an Android app using Kotlin.
   - You can even create a desktop app using JavaFX and Kotlin.
   
   Key Concepts to Apply:
   - Object-oriented and functional programming in Kotlin.
   - Coroutines for async tasks.
   - Use Kotlin-specific libraries and tools to make development easier.

8. Get Involved in the Kotlin Community
   - Check out Kotlin's official blog and stay updated with KotlinConf (Kotlin’s annual conference).
   - Join Kotlin Slack and get help from the community if you’re stuck.
   - Follow developers on Twitter, read blogs, or watch YouTube tutorials for deeper insights.

Summary of the Learning Plan:
1. Set up your environment and play with syntax basics (1 week).
2. Master Kotlin OOP (2 weeks).
3. Learn functional programming features (1-2 weeks).
4. Explore coroutines and asynchronous programming (2-3 weeks).
5. Dive into Kotlin libraries and frameworks (2 weeks).
6. Work on a project for deeper learning and hands-on experience.

Tools You Can Use for Learning:
- JetBrains Academy: Offers Kotlin-specific projects that you can follow step by step.
- Exercism: Has a Kotlin track where you can solve small coding challenges.

This approach gives you flexibility while encouraging hands-on learning. You'll pick things up quickly by diving into the code and building real projects.
